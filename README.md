`updates on 16.07.2020:
  `All cards now will randomly replaced at every time you start different levels, it becomes harder.
  `Re-program JS file for a better & stable work.
  `Devided programs into more smaller size function, to acheive a better maintainable and reuseable purpose.
  `Key binds function will be added shortly.
